There is very few configuration to be done before you are up and running, still the ones you need to add, are as follows:

In the `_config.yml`-file:

{% highlight yaml %}
# name of the docs
name: Stanford Documentation Template

# docs author
author: Stanford Research Computing

# docs version
version: V 1.0
{% endhighlight %}

All of these, minus the version, will be displayed on the top left-hand corner.
